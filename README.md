Shit and EXTREMELY lightweight JS Framework cause i don't like neither Angular nor React and the rest is confusing

### client setup (every time you want to work on the client)
I couldn't be less bothered to program a custom CLI, so just follow these:
- Install some kind of Live HTML previewer on your preferred IDE (**not mandatory**, but makes front-end development easier)
- Enable TailwindCSS by running `npx tailwindcss -i ./views/style.css -o ./views/tailwind.css --watch`
